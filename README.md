# SocialGamerPack
## General Information
This pack is supposed to give a slightly harder and more challenging experience than other official packs like Direwolf20’s.
It also requires **Java 1.8** to run both on clients and servers.

## Introduction
The community of the SocialGamers is a curious one, especially when compared to other communities like the one that's following the big Direwolf20 or others. The way a new member of the community progresses might start off quite a bit harder than in other communities, but unlike others in this one you can get a feeling of accomplishment once you've built your big machine room or set up an intricate farm or base.

You start off by following the teachings of Iguana, where you learn how to use, improve and upgrade your tools by using a Tinkers Construct. Once you have mastered those you will be able to get even the most exotic metals and forge the most powerful weapons.
But you also don't want to focus on just getting all those ores, in this community there has been some Spice of Life added so you will want to have a few different sources of food. So you'll want to look into agriculturing and harvesting all the crops provided to you by Pam in their market.
Once you have your basics for survival covered you might want to look in some of the specialization branches offered to you by the community.

The tech branch starts out with machines that make use of the power of the Ender or if you prefer you can learn about Thermal Expansion and make use of that for some machinery. From there on out you can toy around with many Tools that make use of what is called Redstone Flux, or RF for short. At some point you might also want to make a system that uses Applied Energistics to handle all your storage and other things. And even computers are available! Unlike other civilizations the SocialGamers are not very fond of nuclear power and Big Reactors, but rather they like to use reusable energy sources like Flux from Solar power or different kinds of Generators and Dynamos. The engineers of the community are working hard on finding a way to utilize Rotary mechanics, and it seems that despite the general No Nuclear Power stance of the community some of these engineers are tinkering with the Craft of Reactors, but those seem to still be far off from being usable or even save.

If you're more into the magical aspect and like to dabble in some Thaumaturgy there are a few scribes to be found. There is also talks about a dark cult who uses their own Blood to perform Magic, but be adviced to not get too involved with those. Rumors have it that there have also been witches sighted, but nobody can actually confirm that...

If you're more into the nature aspect and have a green thumb then you might want to try a more Botanical approach, there are a lot of Mystical Flowers after all. If you’re not afraid of getting stung and got way too much time on your hands you might want to look into some Forestry to breed some bees and let those do their magic in providing you with all sorts of resources. If you know someone who is a tinkerer they can maybe provide you with some power so you can Genetically alter those pesky bees and make them behave a bit better. And it seems that you can even breed different kinds of crops that actually grow resources like metals or diamonds, isn't that crazy?

In order to make these branches fit one tree there are lots of Extra Utilities, Compact Storages and Machines, Projects to make Redstone less of a headache and much more.

For the explorers there are also what is called Roguelike Dungeons and Graveyards to explore and loot, but be careful since these are full of hidden dangers! Adventurers even talked of what they call Infernal Mobs which are apparently diabolically hard to fight. There is also talks about the arrival of a certain world that is constantly in a state of twilight, but those are just hushed whispers it seems.

Of course for those that just love building with fancy materials and designs there are lots of possibilities. We have Carpenters, special Chisels and Bibliothecaires that provide you with their decorational knowledge, you can even make fancy looking Paths!

Additionally there are some dark energies at work that aim to make life for the community a bit more difficult overall, for instance exploring caves is now a bit more dangerous because it’s hard to see what lurks in the Darkness. There is also a dark force at work that makes you think twice before you jump into a battle with some zombies and carelessly throw your life away. If you’re not careful your body might end up very damaged to the point where you’ll have to wait quite some time before your health regenerates.

It also seems the that the world’s natural generation of ores like iron or copper has somehow been greatly altered. Instead of just being randomly spread throughout the earth you now seem to have the best chances of finding what you need in those dark dangerous caves. But there are also big rewards for those who dig deep and far: It seems the world has been “blessed” with what can only be described as “super-veins”. These contain almost all the ores you can need in large quantities. Those veins appear to be located very deep down, around the same level you usually would find diamonds or Redstone.
