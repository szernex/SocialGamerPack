			New Block: Framed Chest - Works with the Furniture Paneler to get to color chests using any solid block. The Framed Chest also has a built in single item label that automatically shows the item with the highest quantity in the chest. Chests can be connected into double chests using the screw gun. Double chests will have 2 built in labels and the left side of the chest will select its label item from the top half of the chest inventory and the right side will select from the bottom half of the inventory.
			New Item: Stockroom Catalog - This allows you to list the contents of any number of chests with a single list. Sneak right-click a block with an inventory (a chest, bookcase, barrel, anything with an inventory) to add that inventory to the list of inventories for the catalog to keep track of. Sneak right-click the same block again to remove that block from the list. A small particle effect will render on that block when holding the Stockroom Catalog to let you know that block is being tracked. Right click to open the GUI and see the list. You can sort the list in ascending or descending order by quantity (Count) or alphabetical order. Click on the title to change it to anything so you can custom label your stockroom catalog. click on the small chest icons on the right hand side of each listing to open the inventory list view. This shows you everywhere inventory in your list that item can be found. You will notice 8 slots across the top. If you have any waypoint compasses in your inventory, they will show up in those slots. This allows you to click the compass, then click the + button next to an inventory and add that location to your waypoint compass. Click the close button on the bottom right or hit ESC to close the inventory list view. Hit the exit button on the bottom right or hit esc again to close the GUI.
			New Feature: Fancy workbenches connect to bookcases. Up to 2 bookcases, one on the left and/or one on the right will show their inventory in the fancy workbench.
			New Feature: Recipe books can now be used to craft items without a workbench if the player has the required ingredients in their inventory.

		* r1.7-219
			Added comparator support to the T.A. Plate.
			Added ForgeMultipart microblock support.

			Added the Manufactory Halo, effectively an automatic Assembly Halo.
			Capped the flower patch size config option to 8 blocks to prevent worldgen crashes when the generator seeps into other chunks and forces the world to generate a new chunk while already generating one.
			Changed the Assembly Halo's glow to be green rather than pink, it also properly renders on the outside now.
			Fixed an exploit that made the Exoflame ridiculously fuel efficient.
	* EnderCore 0.1.0.19_beta : 0.1.0.23_beta
	* McJtyLib 1.3.0 : 1.4.0
		* 1.4.0

	* PneumaticCraft 1.11.1-121-universal : 1.11.2-122-universal
		* 1.11.2-122-universal
			Added player to player Amadron trading.

			Bugfix: Programmer shows "Sneak for info" instead of the names of the returned puzzle pieces when programming a Drone.
			Bugfix: Drop Item piece shows 'All Sides' even though it doesn't use sides.
			Bugfix: Logistic Drone gets stuck when a Logistic Frame can't be reached (it's completely surrounded with blocks).

			Bugfix: Entity Tracker does not update the name of an Entity when it is changed while tracking.

			Bugfix: Entity Tracker gives you a 'mob is targeting you' warning even when the Entity Tracker is disabled.
			Bugfix: PneumaticCraft liquids don't behave as other liquids (no viscosity, no view depth changed when inside). This does introduce the fact that you can right-click the liquids with an empty bottle to get a water bottle again, but this is a Minecraft derp thing I can't control (except when using serious hacks).
	* ProjectRed - Base 4.7.0pre8.92-Base : 4.7.0pre9.92-Base

			New advanced charged porter that supports multiple destinations (4), has a bigger energy capacity and works four times faster.

			Depend on mcjtylib 1.4.0 to fix a bug with the style button on item gui's.
			Fixed the RF network monitor giving wrong RF/t values
			Put the shield projector + shield blocks to the builder blacklist as moving it doesn't work very nicely.
			Fixed a problem where the matter receiver was configured to need no power. This would cause rftools to crash. Doesn't occur in normal rftools usage.
		* 3.35
			Fixed a bug with the 'no rain' and 'no thunder' dimlets on servers. These dimlets would cause crashes on servers (since 3.34). Single player was ok.
			Fixed invisible shield blocks from still making adjacent non-shield blocks appear darker. Now invisible shield blocks are truely invisible.
			Fixed a typo in the shield projector GUI.

			Added Mithril and Platinum ores to the orechid's list. (phantamanta44)
			Added the Rod of the Shifting Crust, effectively a copy of the Thaumcraft Wand of Equal trade with a few new things added on.
			Changed the Rune of Sloth in the Orechid recipe to a Rune of Greed. Turns out I planned the rune recipes really poorly, the only thing you could make with the greed rune for the longest time was the bore lens. Since the new rod uses a sloth rune I moved this around and now all is balanced :D
			Fixed a crash when you /give yourself a botania flower with the wrong metadata.
			Fixed more typos.
			Fixed the Corporea Index kicking you out of the server if you try requesting an item with control codes in the name (such as brews).
			Fixed the Flugel Tiara rubberbanding in multiplayer. Maybe. Hopefully. Probably not.
			Fixed the Flugel Tiara using CodeChickenLib Vector3 rather than Botania Vector3, causing crashes if the item is worn without NEI loaded.
			Fixed the Flugel Tiara's sprint delay being 1.5 seconds rather than the intended 3 seconds, also changed it to 2 seconds, so the intended is now 2 seconds rather than 3 seconds. So this line should read "Fixed the Flugel Tiara's sprint delay being 1.5 seconds rather than the intended 2 seconds", but the intended was 3 seconds before and 2 seconds now because 2 seconds feels better than 3 seconds. I don't even know.
			Fixed the Hand of Ender being stackable.
			Fixed the Hovering Hourglass accepting any item through automation and not just sand and not syncing its contents properly when its inventory is changed through automation.
			Fixed the name suffix of the Black Hole Talisman not using the block's damage value to get the name.
			Fixed the Tiara flight bar not rendering with Tinkers Construct. (TheWhiteWolves)
			Rewrote the way the conversion in the Mana Fluxfield works to prevent a dupe with EnderIO capacitors banks.
			The "Items Remaining" display now has colors to make it easier to read if there's multiple stacks left.
			Trying to infuse an item with a Diluted Mana Pool now shows a "Upgrade your Mana Pool to infuse this item" indicator.
			Updated the Force Relay entry to say how to break the block properly.

			Added Pressure Chamber Wall + Pressure Tube = 1x Pressure Chamber Valve recipe.

			Bugfix: Various thing in the mod break when setting gamerule doDaylightCycle to false.
	* RFTools 3.32 : 3.33
		Fixed an exploit with the builder mode in copy for blocks were different meta means a different block and not just a different color.
		Made the stacksize of dimlets configurable. Default is still 16.
		Changed ore dictionary dimlet registration so that it will try to find the most expensive entries given by IMC or config to create the final dimlet. This is for situations where there are multiple versions of the same ore in the dictionary and multiple mods assign different rarities/costs to each of these ores. RFTools will then find all the configuration values for that dimlet and pick the most expensive one. If one of the mods blacklists the ore then it will be blacklisted for all.
		Fixed IMC message blacklisting of dimlets.
		Worked around a bug in the crafter when crafting fireworks in some situations.
