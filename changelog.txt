Version 1.7.10-0.1.6
* disabled MobiousCore and Opis by default
* added Railcraft

./scripts/thermal_expansion.zs
	* changed Igneous Extruder recipe to require diamonds and bronze gears to prevent sneaky material progression to Obsidian tools (it requires the same level tools as you would need to mine Obsidian now)

./scripts/tinkers_construct.zs
	* removed shaped crafting recipe for TConstruct Block of Steel to prevent conflict with Railcraft Block of Steel. TConstruct one can be crafted using a smeltery and basin or Chisel.

Updates
	* Botania r1.7-208 : r1.7-210
		* r1.7-209
			Added a recipe for cobwebs.
			Added factorization's new dark iron ore dictionary key to the orechid's list. (TheWhiteWolves)
			Added Relic Knowledge, a new knowledge type for relics. This knowledge is unlocked by opening the lexicon with a relic in the inventory. The contents update dynamically depending on what relic achievements have so far been acquired. This replaces the poems in the relics' tooltips.
			Added the ability for botania armor and baubles to have Thaumcraft runic shielding. (ruifung)
			Added the Slime in a Bottle, effectively a slime chunk detector.
			Added the Starcaller by very popular request. A new sword that makes shooting stars. Yes, it's the Starfury/Star Wrath from terraria.
			Changed the 1.9 brick textures to the actual ones from the 1.9 snapshot jar.
			Changed the element and season runes' textures to new versions in Sosho by miznib.
			Changed the hardcore passive generation value to 48000 by default instead of 24000. It was supposed to be that to begin with but I can't do math.
			Dice of Fate dropped by the Gaia Guardian now bind on drop rather than on pickup.
			Fixed baubles that store mana not updating the mana bar above the XP bar in real time.
			Fixed being able to remove water from the Petal Apothecary with a bucket in GoG, allowing for water to be acquired a lot earlier.
			Fixed fake players locking the multiblock display.
			Fixed more typos.
			Fixed some botania entities not having proper localizations.
			Fixed some of the double tall flowers having secondary drops.
			Fixed the Ritual of Gaia's multiblock display only accepting iron rather than all valid beacon blocks.
			Fixed the sashes not being counted as mana using items despite using mana.
			Fixed there being duped text in the runic altar entry.
			Hydroangeas are now quieter.
			Increased the Hopperhock's vertical range by one block.
			Lowered the default and max radius of /botania-skyblock-spread by a tenfold to prevent floating point errors such as hopperhocks not recognising item frames at extreme distances.
			Made the Rod of the Molten Core's sound a lot less infuriating.
			Passive flowers now get replaced with Dead Bushes when they despawn rather than getting removed altogether.
			Prismarine now animates properly.
			Removed the Holy Sword Excaliber and replaced it with something far cooler.
			Removed the regen from the Ring of Odin. It already gives you a full heart bar, come on.
			Replaced the Mana Pool HUD's Sparing/Accepting text with a more pleasing visual.
			Repurposed the Eye of the Flugel a bit, I wasn't happy with what it did before.
			The Dice of Fate no longer hurts players if they're not the right owner.
			The elven portal is now much faster at outputting the stuff you put in.
			The Flugel Tiara now has a limit of how much you can fly with it.
			The Fruit of Grisaia, Ring of Loki and Eye of the Flugel now use mana.
			The Gaia Guardian's difficulty and rewards now scale on the amount of players participating.
			The hardmode Gaia Guardian now drops a lot more runes.
			The Pink Wither no longer drops Nether Stars.
			The Wither effect the Gaia Guardian's purple fire creates can no longer be healed by milk or brew of absorption.
		* r1.7-210
			Added the ability to Dash and Glide to the Flugel Tiara, read on these new abilities in the book!
			Fixed a major dupe with the Resolute Ivy and container items.
			Fixed more typos.
			Fixed the recipe for the spectral platform crashing the client if used with the Shift-? feature in NEI.
			Hopperhocks now check all 6 sides instead of only the 4 cardinal directions. (iambob314)
			The Flugel Tiara no longer sets you on fire if you run out of charge, that was a cool thematic idea but it ended up just being annoying and dumb.
	* MagicBees 1.7.10-2.3.3 : 1.7.10-2.3.4
		Added Enchanted Soil: magical dirtstuff that will make plants grow faster, especially when stacked in farms and wider areas.
	* NotEnoughKeys 1.7.10-1.0.0.b29 : 1.7.10-1.0.0.b30
	* StorageDrawers 1.7.10-1.5.13 : 1.7.10-1.5.14
		Fixed block label rendering for some users (it would appear to 'sink' into the drawer).
		Fixed illegible numbers in drawer GUI when using the unicode font.
		Fixed incorrect recipe for refined relocation version of compacting drawers.
